# HealthHarbor

## Inspiration
In today's world, health has never been more paramount. Healthcare professionals are facing unprecedented demands on their time and resources. Our goal is to provide a solution that benefits both medical providers and patients alike.

## What it does
By incorporating Cohere's comprehensive language model API into our project, weâ€™ve developed a pharmaceutical inventory management system that enhances the workflow for doctors and medical practitioners. HealthHarbor leverages an efficient, scalable database that classifies medications and provides a robust AI clustering system that diagnoses diseases and recommends medications using cutting-edge AI language models. These metrics are calculated through our linear algebraic models and then delivered to our users through an elegant UI interface on their computer or their phone. We provide an effective and efficient way for doctors to diagnose patients.

## How we built it
We meticulously planned our design process and task delegation using a comprehensive tech stack model to prioritize our Minimum Viable Product. Our main database is powered by CockroachDB, the backend is developed using Flask, and our frontend is built with TypeScript, React, and ChakraUI.

## Challenges we ran into
During the project, we faced challenges such as resolving merge conflicts and navigating documentation intricacies. We also had to balance our schedules between food and development time, so we conducted our hourly stand-up while standing in the long lines :)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take pride in achieving the following milestones:

- Successfully completing the project on time
- Seamlessly integrating CockroachDB and Cohere into our system
- Leveraging a wide array of frameworks and libraries
- Implementing rigorous integration and unit testing
- Successfully hosting our platform on Digital Ocean for both the frontend and backend.

## What we learned
We discovered that successful teamwork in Software Development relies on clear communication and shared goals. Additionally, we realized the vital importance of carefully planning both the finer intricacies and the broader aspects of our project to ensure the smooth execution of our plans.

## What's next for HealthHarbor
Looking ahead, we have several exciting plans:

- Implementing advanced metrics
- Expanding our dataset
- Scaling our platform to reach a broader audience
- Adding more innovative features to further enhance our offerings.
